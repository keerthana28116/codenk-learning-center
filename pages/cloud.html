<p>☁️ Cloud computing allows users to store, manage, and process data on cloud platforms like AWS and Azure.</p>

<p>🌐 Cloud computing is a modern technology that allows users to store, manage, and process data over the internet instead of relying on local servers or personal computers. It has transformed the way businesses and individuals use technology by providing flexible, scalable, and cost-effective solutions. Cloud computing enables access to computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and software from anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>⚡ One of the major advantages of cloud computing is scalability. Organizations can increase or decrease resources based on their needs without investing in physical infrastructure. This makes cloud computing ideal for startups, enterprises, and growing businesses. Cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud provide powerful tools and services that support application development, data storage, and analytics.</p>

<p>🔒 Cloud computing is widely used in web hosting, data backup, disaster recovery, and application deployment. It supports modern technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data. Learning cloud computing helps students understand how applications are deployed and managed in real-world environments. It also introduces concepts like virtualization, cloud security, and service models such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.</p>
