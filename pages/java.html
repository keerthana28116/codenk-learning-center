Java is a popular programming language used for
software development, web applications, and Android apps.
</p>
<p> •
    java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the world. It is known for its reliability, security, and platform independence, which makes it a preferred choice for enterprise-level applications. Java follows the principle of “write once, run anywhere,” meaning that Java programs can run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine. This feature makes Java highly versatile and suitable for large-scale applications.
</p>
<p> •
Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means it focuses on concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. These concepts help developers write modular, reusable, and maintainable code. Learning Java helps students understand how real-world software systems are designed and developed. Java is commonly used in web applications, desktop applications, mobile applications (especially Android), banking systems, and enterprise software.
</p>
<p> •
One of the key strengths of Java is its strong memory management and built-in security features. Java handles memory allocation automatically through garbage collection, reducing the risk of memory leaks. Its robust security model makes it suitable for applications that require high levels of data protection. Java also has a vast collection of libraries and frameworks such as Spring and Hibernate, which simplify application development.
